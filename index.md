I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at UC Merced, advised by Shilpa Khatri and Roummel Marcia. My research interest is in machine learning, and my current project involved machine learning, optimization, and fluid dynamics. Additionally, I am a DOD SMART Scholar with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency in Springfield, VA. 
<br>
My research focuses on modeling the fluid flow created by pulsing corals. This fluid flow analysis is typically done numerically, but I aim to implement to implement neural networks to act as a surrogate for this process. I also hope to implement optimization techniques to find under what parameters the corals pulse to create the most fluid flow.
